        We are Dee & Jay of the House ParoDeeJay, first of our names, makers of
        songs, cruisers of ships, the sometimes-sunburnt, creators of nonsense,
        vloggers of randomness, and parents of kitties. We started our YouTube
        journey in 2013 as a way to release homemade, no-budget parody and cover
        songs, and eventually added videos on cooking, challenges, gaming,
        travel & more. Basically, our channel is a big ol' mixed bag of things
        that we enjoy, and we hope you'll join us for some crazy adventures!
